as our keynote speaker for iEvoBio this year. Her talk will be on Friday, June 23 
from 9-10 am, with details as follows:

**Democratizing Data Skills to Advance Data-Driven Discovery**

Our increasing capacity to collect data is changing research. 
There is great potential for discovery, but we are primarily failing 
to translate this sea of data into research advances, because researchers 
are not trained in the skills needed for effective management, analysis and 
software development. It is not tools that do the work to turn data into 
knowledge or make discoveries. It is people who turn information into 
knowledge by creating the software and analyzing data. By making software 
and data accessible and putting the data skills and the perspectives in 
the hands of all researchers, we allow them to answer their own questions 
and capture their passion and expert knowledge. When we limit the number or 
types of people who do this work, we're losing that curiosity, that drive, 
that expert knowledge.The question then becomes, in addition to scaling data 
production and computation, how do we democratize data-driven research and scale 
data and software development skills training along with data production.
