## Lightning Talks

The following lightning talks will occur on Friday, June 23 between 10:30 am and noon. 
Please click the link to view authors and abstracts. If you are presenting, 
please be prepared to load your talk during the coffee break prior to the session 
(iEvoBio does not require loading of talks 24 hours in advance as with the rest of the Evolution conference). 
If you would like to submit a lightning talk, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/2017-iEvoBio/organization/issues).
