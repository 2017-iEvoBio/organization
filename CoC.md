## Code of Conduct

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do 
not tolerate harassment of participants in any form, either at the meeting or 
during the planning process.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual 
orientation/identity/expression, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion; 
deliberate intimidation; stalking; following; harassing photography or 
recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical
contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other 
exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the 
organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the 
offender or expulsion from the event with no refund of any fee that may have 
been levied.

You may report violations of this Code of Conduct to either Kate Hertweck (k8hertweck@gmail.com) or Daisie Huang (daisieh@gmail.com).
