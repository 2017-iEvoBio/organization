# iEvoBio 2017

The iEvoBio conference will take place before and during the first day
of the Evolution Conference, June 23-24, 2017, in Portland, OR.

iEvoBio is an unconference: a good part of the organization and the
topics being discussed are decided by the participants before and
during the event. The theme of 2017 iEvoBio is "Reproducibility
challenges for non-computational biologists".

**Please make sure you have [registered](http://www.evolutionmeetings.org/registration.html) to iEvoBio (it is seperate from the Evolution conference registration but uses the same system)**

### How to submit a proposal for a Bird of a Feather topic/lighting talk/software bazaar?

We are going coordinate this pre-conference discussion through GitHub. GitHub is
a website that can be used to share source code. It also provides a really nice
forum-like discussion tool through "issues". We ask anyone who would like to
present to the Software Bazaar, propose a topic for birds of a feather, or
lighting talk,
to [open an issue](https://github.com/2017-iEvoBio/organization/issues/new). The issue is prepopulated with a template for each of the possible proposal types. Modify this template to make it look like the examples for [a lighting talk](https://github.com/2017-iEvoBio/organization/issues/7), [a Bird of a Feather topic](https://github.com/2017-iEvoBio/organization/issues/6), or [a Software bazaar](https://github.com/2017-iEvoBio/organization/issues/5). Each iEvoBio participant can submit one lighting talk and one Software bazaar proposal. They can however submit multiple Bird of a feather topics.

We encourage all users to discuss these topics, find like-minded people to work
with at iEvoBio or make contact with software developers for whom you have
questions. The discussions on GitHub are subject to our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/2017-iEvoBio/organization/blob/master/CoC.md).


### What is GitHub and why do a need an account?

We want the short amount of time we have for iEvoBio to be as useful as possible
for everyone who attends. For that reason we encourage conference-goers to
talk among themselves about what they might work on, talk about or hope to learn
during the meeting.

In order to contribute to these discussion you will need to sign up for an
account at https://github.com/join. [Github provides some nice documentation for
making the most out of github issues](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/),
though none of the features described there are needed to contribute to a
discussion.
