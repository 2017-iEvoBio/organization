# iEvoBio 2017

The iEvoBio conference will take place before and during the first day
of the Evolution Conference, June 23-24, 2017, in Portland, OR.

iEvoBio is an unconference: a good part of the organization and the
topics being discussed are decided by the participants before and
during the event. The theme of the 2017 iEvoBio is "reproducibility
challenges for non-computional biologists".
